* Note that clues are now worth $50, free hunters exist, you cannot equip two large slot weapons anymore, nights are not as dark as shown in the video, and quickplay, training mode and trials have been added since.

# Console (PS4, XBOX)

Quick disclaimer: I don't play on console, but I wanted to have something here for console players because I know from discussions on this subreddit that console plays differently to PC. If you have suggestions for great console-based Hunt content, post a comment and if it gets a decent amount of upvotes, I will add it to here.
