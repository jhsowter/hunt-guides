# About this site
This site was originally a [post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/iufiqk/so_youre_new_to_hunt_showdown/). The post was intended to help new players get started in hunt, as well as help existing players get better, by suggesting good videos and articles. Mostly, this came out of a frustration that the stickied content on reddit was out of date, and missed a lot of important topics.
